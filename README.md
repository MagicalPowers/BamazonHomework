### BamazonHomework

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

### Organization
This node.js CLI application uses several node packages to communicate with a mySQL database, display the current contents of a "products" table to the user, allow the user to select a product and quantity to 'buy', and process this request by checking against the stock level, displaying the total price to the user, and modifying the mySQL database to adjust inventory levels and product sale totals.

### How-to operate

After cloning the repository to your machine, run 'npm install' in your Bash/terminal. Typing 'node bamazonCustomer.js' will run the Customer program which will display a table of the currently listed products with an id, price, and quantity. Now, choose a product and choose how much you want to buy. The Bamazon app will process your sale and list your total price.

### Proof Positive
include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs
